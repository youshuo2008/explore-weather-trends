### Project Title
Explore weather trends

### Project Description
This project is part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
I'm interested in finding out the average temperature changes over the recent 200 years of where I live (New York), and comparing it to the global trend.
To obtain the data, I queried a SQL relational database from Udacity's workspace and downloaded the results as a csv file into my local computer.
Then, I used Excel to calculate the 7-day moving average of the New York and global yearly average temperature, and generated a line plot.
Finally, I summarized my findings in a PDF report.   

### Files used
The csv files used in the project was obtained using SQL querying from Udacity's database server. 

### Credits
Special thanks to my Udacity teachers: Richard Kalehoff, Juno Lee, Karl Krueger, Josh Bernhard, Sebastian Thrun, Mike Yi, Daivid Venturi, Mat Leonard, Sam Nelson, Derek Steer and mentors: Raj V and George L.
